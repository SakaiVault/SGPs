**Sakai Governance Proposals repository**


Sakai Vault Decentralized Autonomous Organization, SakaiDAO is a community platform that empowers Sakai Vault token stakers to participate in the governance of Sakai Vault ecosystem.&#x20;

SAKAI holders can stake their tokens to vote on important proposals. In hierarchy, users can create proposal (SDP) for Sakai Vault development. In return, they receive rewards in SAKAI from part of activities on SAKAI ecosystem. At this stage, 3% out of 5% claiming fee from Staking Program. These percent can change with proposal which created from stakeholders on DAO. In the future, as more users join and more protocol added, more rewards will be generated.

The voting process is fully transparent. Since voting is an on-chain operation, it will have a transaction hash and other details that will be available for anyone to review on BSCscan. Results are achieved through a democratic process - proposal options with the highest voting points win.
