# Allow V1 Stakers to Allocate 1% of V1 Claiming Balance for Liquidity Farming Participation

This proposal is aimed at enhancing the value proposition for V1 Stakers by giving them an additional option to utilize a portion of their V1 staking rewards in a more dynamic and profitable way. Currently, the V1 Staking Pool is paying out a daily interest rate of 0.05%. We propose an option that allows stakers to convert 1% of their current V1 claiming balance into a wallet, which can then be combined with $PAXE tokens to participate in the Sakai x PAXE Liquidity Farming Pool.




Key Benefits from this proposal:

\- Increased Flexibility for Stakers: V1 Stakers can convert their staking rewards faster and at higher yields through Liquidity Farming, potentially surpassing the 0.05% daily interest provided by V1 Staking.

\- Boost in Liquidity for Sakai and PAXE: This proposal would incentivize more users to participate in the liquidity farming pool, which would strengthen the liquidity and overall health of both $SAKAI and $PAXE tokens.



How It Works:

1\. Conversion Option: V1 Stakers will be able to choose an option in their staking dashboard to convert 1% of their V1 claiming balance to a wallet address provided by Dev team.

2\. Combine with $PAXE: Users can then pair the equivalent $PAXE tokens with converted $SAKAI to enter the Liquidity Farming Pool.

3\. Liquidity Farming: Once in the farming pool, users will be able to earn daily farming rewards and enjoy the benefits of diversified earnings.



Expected Outcome:

\- Empowers V1 Stakers with more earning opportunities while helping to increase liquidity within the Sakai x PAXE ecosystem.Â 

\- Provides a way for stakers to actively engage with the farming product, ultimately contributing to the strength of our platform.



As a V1 staker, we urge the DAO to consider this proposal and vote in favor to unlock this new opportunity for our community. We encourage all DAO members to vote and share their feedback on this.
