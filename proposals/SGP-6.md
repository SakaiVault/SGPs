# A Bold Leap Forward: Revolutionizing Sakai Vault for a Decentralized Future

This proposal aims to create long-term sustainability and accelerated growth of Sakai Vault ecosystem.&#x20;

Introducing sUSD, Sakai-Peg USD, Sakai Vault unveils a Game-Changing Evolution. This aspect move shortens the development timeline by 3-5 years, allowing us to achieve our goals faster and create a more robust ecosystem for all participants. With sUSD, we can create the strongest digital currency that could extend beyond the current cryptocurrency landscape, paving the way for a stronger, more adaptive, and future-proof Sakai Vault.



**#1. Key Aspects of Sakai-Peg USD (sUSD) Token:**



\- *Issuance*: The sUSD token will be pegged to the total wallet balance in both V1 staking pool (Ratio 1:1 with total USDT balance). It is important to note that the value of sUSD will be converted to USD value on the total claimable balance, so there is no fear of being affected by the SAKAI token price.



*- Total Supply*: Will be minted in an amount equal to the total claimable balance from V1 pool.



\- *Transferability*: Users who have claimable balance will be able to claim the equivalent amount of sUSD to their wallet. sUSD can only be transferred to the user's own wallet & cannot be traded or transferred to others. 

E.g. If a user’s claimable balance is $24,000, they will receive 24,000 sUSD into their wallet.



\- *Usage*: Users can pair sUSD in their wallet with strategic partner - PAXE tokens to join the Farming pool. After success farming, all farmed sUSD will be burnt.



At the begining, this token will not function as a general currency but will be used exclusively for participation in liquidity farming paired with PAXE, with the added benefit that all sUSD utilized in farming will be burned. After that, sUSD will offer additional utility beyond rewards, such as exclusive access to new platform features, and participation in special events.



**#2. Benefits to the Community**:

*- Improved Liquidity & Faster Rewards:* With the introduction of sUSD, users can experience better liquidity and faster daily rewards through the farming pools. Nevertheless, users can also experience Restaking Program, which allows them to optimize their earning potential and actively participate in the growth of the ecosystem.



*- Win-win scenario for all*: As the farm sales program strengthens and attracts more participants, the entire ecosystem of Sakai Vault and PAXE will benefit. This initiative sets the foundation for long-term sustainability, helping both projects evolve together in a mutually beneficial partnership.



*- Enhanced Growth Potential*: With the introduction of sUSD, we are laying the groundwork for exciting future partnerships, integrations, and developments that will help drive the value and utility of our platform.



The Sakai Vault ecosystem will become stronger and more sustainable as we implement this plan. We are inviting the DAO Mayors to participate in shaping this key initiative by contributing their opinions and ideas. The goal is to gather insights, refine the proposal, and implement a completed, powerful solution that benefits the entire community.
