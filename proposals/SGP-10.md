# Additional Proposal to sUSD: Roadmap for Expanded Usage of sUSD

**Additional Proposal to sUSD: Roadmap for Expanded Usage of sUSD**



I want to propose the establishment of sUSD as the main governance token within the Sakai Vault ecosystem, gradually replacing the SAKAI token for governance purposes. As sUSD becomes more integrated into the ecosystem, its expanded usage will streamline governance and strengthen community participation.

Keys from this proposal:

\- Introduce a long-term roadmap to transition sUSD as the primary governance token for all features in Sakai Vault.

\- Replace SAKAI with sUSD for voting and governance-related activities.

\- This change ensures that sUSD becomes central to the ecosystem, further solidifying its role in both farming and governance. 



I have strong believe in this proposal and wish to earn a “YES” vote from DAO Mayors. Please consider and vote for me! Thank you.
