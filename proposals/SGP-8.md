# Implementation of sUSD for Sakai Vault ecosystem

Proposal: Implementation of sUSD for Sakai Vault ecosystem

Date: Sept 15th 2024



Objective

This proposal aims to push sUSD become the staking reward of Sakai Vault in V1, replacing the current reward structure using $SAKAI token

This transition will enhance the tokenomics, increase utility, and ensure long-term growth and sustainability within the ecosystem.



Background

Currently, rewards in the Sakai staking program are distributed in $SAKAI token. While this system has been effective in incentivizing staking participation, it has led to certain challenges, such as the lack of tokens in pool, limited reward utility, and concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of rewards distribution.



To address these concerns, the project team could shift to sUSD, valued as USDT as the staking reward, which brings several advantages to V1 staking users



Rationale for Change

Mitigating Inflationary Pressure:

By transitioning to sUSD, the reward distribution can be better controlled and preserving its long-term value.



Enhanced Utility for Rewards:

sUSD may offer additional utility beyond staking rewards, such as governance voting and exclusive access to new functions, etc



Project Growth & Innovation:

A token with stable value is integral to Sakai Vault future roadmap, serving as the foundation for upcoming developments. It will help drive demand and adoption, benefiting the overall ecosystem.



Laucnching Date: As soon as possible 



Conclusion

The introduction of sUSD in the V1 staking reward will provide Sakai Vault with a more sustainable, utility-rich, and future-proof reward system. By enhancing the token’s utility and improving the long-term health of our ecosystem, this change is a crucial step toward ensuring the continued growth and success of the project.



I kindly ask for community feedback and approval on this proposal. Hope that sUSD will be launced soon

Thank you
