# Open sUSD Staking Option to DAO for Voting Power

This proposal aims to allow users to stake their sUSD into Sakai DAO in exchange for increased voting power. By staking sUSD, users will gain a greater influence in future governance decisions, ensuring that active participants in the Sakai Vault ecosystem have a stronger voice in shaping the future of the platform.



When users stake sUSD in the DAO, their total voting power will be determined by the value of their staked sUSD. If they stake both SAKAI and sUSD, their voting power will simply be the combined value of both tokens, ensuring their influence is proportionate to their total stake.



This change will incentivize participation in both farming and governance, encouraging long-term engagement within the community. I hope other DAO members will vote "YES". Thank you.
