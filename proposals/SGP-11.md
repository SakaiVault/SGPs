# BONUS POOL - A new DAO Benefit for Active Participation in DAO Governance 

BONUS POOL - A new DAO Benefit for Active Participation in DAO Governance 



In light of the current reduced benefits from the DAO revenue-sharing system due to the V1-V2 situation, I want to add in a new DAO Bonus proposal to help compensate for the lack of revenue-sharing for DAO stakers around the globe. My proposal is to create a bonus reward system for active DAO stakers who has already contributed successful, executed proposals for Sakai Vault community.



Bonus Pool Definition: This monthly bonus pool will be created to reward DAO members based on their governance activity, such as:

   - Submitting at least 3 proposals.

   - Participating in votes.

   - Getting at least 1 successful, executed proposal.



The Rewards Structure: Rewards could come in the form of SAKAI tokens or additional sUSD, which would be distributed monthly based on contribution level.



This scheme will encourage higher engagement within the DAO, keeping DAO stakers active and interested while generating more ideas for ecosystem improvements. 



I encourage my fellow DAO Mayors and stakers to vote “YES” as well as share their thoughts, feedback, and proposals to help shape and improve this initiative. By working together, we can keep the DAO thriving and rewarding for everyone involved.
