# Deactivation of V1 Staking Pool and Transfer of SAKAI Tokens to V2 Staking Pool 

Deactivation of V1 Staking Pool and Transfer of SAKAI Tokens to V2 Staking Pool 



As a dedicated V2 staker, I understand the importance of fairness and balance in our ecosystem. Recently, it has come to my attention that V1 stakers continue to claim and sell their rewards daily, which can negatively affect the value of $SAKAI, while V2 stakers face restrictions due to stop-loss mechanisms. In the interest of protecting the long-term sustainability of our platform and ensuring fairness for all members, I am proposing that we deactivate the V1 Staking Pool and transfer all staked $SAKAI tokens from V1 to the V2 Staking Pool.



By unifying both staking pools into 1, we can work together to build a stronger future for everyone involved. As we see, maintaining two staking pools dilutes liquidity and creates stress on both. By consolidating staking into one pool, we can focus on delivering the best possible experience for all stakers. That’s why we should deactivation of V1 Staking Pool.



After the transfer is complete, the V2 Pool will reach the 1,200,000 SAKAI tokens quickly, thus be fully reopened. All stakers, including those whose tokens were transferred, will start earning V2 rewards immediately.



I really hope all members will vote and approve this proposal, as it benefits both current stakers and the long-term health of the Sakai ecosystem.
