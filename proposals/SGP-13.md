# Conversion of V2 Staking Pool SAKAI to sUSD for Enhanced Liquidity and Profitability

**Conversion of V2 Staking Pool SAKAI to sUSD for Enhanced Liquidity and Profitability**



Hello, I'm a V2 staker. I have observed the conversion method applied to V1 stakers, which has proven to bring significant benefits of faster liquidity and better profits for the community. The implementation of Sakai-Peg USD (sUSD) and its integration into farming with PAXE has provided a great pathway for V1 stakers to maximize their yield potential. And I can clearly see that everyone in V1 is happy with it. 



However, the current situation for V2 stakers is challenging. Reaching the required 1.2 million SAKAI tokens before the claim function is activated seems like a distant goal, leaving us with uncertainty about when we will be able to claim our investments. There are many V2 stakers share the same concerns about the timeline and the liquidity of our assets.



That's why I am proposing a solution that can mirror the success of V1's conversion mechanism and provide a similar opportunity to V2 stakers.



I. Proposal of Converting V2 Staked SAKAI to sUSD: 

Similar to what was done in V1, please allow the conversion of SAKAI tokens in the V2 staking pool to sUSD. V2 Stakers can immediately claim all their balance to the wallet. For those who have invested in the ongoing staking period will continue to receive interest as usual until the end of that period.&#x20;

This interest includes:

\- Daily Interest

\- Commission Rewards: Sponsor Level Daily Income, Same Level Reward, Ranking Reward



This will give V2 stakers access to immediate & proactive liquidity. They don't have to wait until the 1.2 million SAKAI target is reached and can flexibly manage their assets.



II. Implement a Farming Conversion Mechanism with PAXE: 

Once V2 stakers have received sUSD, they should have the option to pair their sUSD with PAXE for farming, just as V1 stakers are currently able to do.

This shows the fairness across both V1 and V2 pools, offering equal opportunities to all stakers while maintaining long-term ecosystem stability.



In summary, this proposal aims to provide a better solution for V2 stakers who are eager to maximize their profits and liquidity. By converting SAKAI to sUSD and allowing farming with PAXE, we can create a balanced and prosperous staking environment for all. I urge fellow DAO members to vote YES to this proposal, as it would benefit the entire community and enhance the future of Sakai Vault.
