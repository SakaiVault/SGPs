# Decrease Minimum Staking Requirement to Join Sakai DAO from 2000 SAKAI to 1000 SAKAI

This proposal seeks to reduce the minimum staking requirement to join Sakai DAO from 2000 SAKAI to 1000 SAKAI. By lowering the entry threshold, we aim to make participation more accessible and attract a larger, more diverse group of users. This strategic change would ultimately:

\- Increased DAO Participation

\- Strengthening Community Engagement

\- Boosting the DAO’s Overall Influence



By welcoming a larger number of participants into the decision-making process, we ensure that Sakai Vault continues to evolve as a truly decentralized and community-driven platform.




Vote a "YES" if you guys agree that lowering the minimum staking requirement to 1000 SAKAI will fuel greater participation and thus improve Sakai Vault’s long-term stability.
