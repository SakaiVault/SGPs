# Introduce Exclusive Whitelist Round for DAO Stakers

**Introduce Exclusive Whitelist Round for DAO Stakers**



To further incentivize participation in the DAO, this proposal seeks to introduce an exclusive benefit for DAO Stakers: priority whitelist access to private token sales or early purchase rounds with Sakai Vault's strategic partners.



Overview:

The core idea behind this proposal is to link DAO staking commitment directly to whitelist access. The amount of tokens you will be eligible to purchase in these exclusive rounds will be proportionate to how much SAKAI you have staked in the DAO. Simply put:



\- The more you stake, the more you can purchase.

\- Those who stake smaller amounts will have a proportionally smaller purchasing limit.

\- These exclusive sales will be announced well in advance, allowing DAO stakers ample time to plan, prepare, and fully capitalize on each opportunity.



This system ensures that the most dedicated and committed DAO stakers are rewarded with greater opportunities. At the same time, those who are just getting started in the DAO can still participate and increase their purchasing potential as they stake more in the future.



Strategic Value of Whitelisting:

With Sakai Vaultâ€™s history of strategic partnerships, such as the successful collaboration with PAXE, these token rounds will be carefully curated to ensure that all projects are reputable, safe, and promising in terms of potential returns. By offering whitelist access to these exclusive sales, we aim to give DAO stakers a competitive edge in entering new markets early, which could lead to significant financial gains.



Please support this initiative and vote "YES" to unlock future growth, profitability, and exclusive benefits for all participants.
