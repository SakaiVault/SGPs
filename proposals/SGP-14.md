# Increase DAO Treasury Support to Offset Reduced Revenue-Sharing

**Increase DAO Treasury Support to Offset Reduced Revenue-Sharing**



Due to the current decrease in benefits from the DAO revenue-sharing system, I propose that Sakai Vault increases the monthly DAO Treasury Support to compensate for the reduced transaction fees. This proposal would call for an additional allocation of 36,000 SAKAI tokens from the Staking Pool Monthly Support Strategy to be directed towards the DAO Revenue-Sharing Treasury. 



Reason:

As seen in V1 successful conversion to sUSD, in a scenario where V2 is proposed to also convert to sUSD, if the proposal for V2 is approved and implemented, the treasury system will no longer need to provide SAKAI tokens to the V2 staking pool every month. Currently, the Sakai Vault project allocates up to 50,000 SAKAI tokens monthly to support both staking pools, and I believe this allocation should be redirected to benefit the DAO’s revenue-sharing system instead.



This shift will enhance the benefits for DAO stakers, who play a crucial role in making key development decisions for the project. 



Distribution Plan:

The additional tokens will be distributed in proportion to each user’s staked amount in the DAO, ensuring a fair and transparent revenue-sharing mechanism that rewards active participants.



By increasing the monthly support for DAO stakers, the DAO governance system more financially rewarding and attractive, driving long-term growth for the Sakai Vault ecosystem. 



My fellow DAO Mayors and stakers, if you support this proposal, please vote "YES" to help bring this idea to life. By collaborating, we can ensure the DAO remains a thriving and rewarding environment for all participants.
