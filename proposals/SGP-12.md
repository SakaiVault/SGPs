# Implement a New Fee Structure to Increase Revenue-Sharing for DAO Stakers

**Implement a New Fee Structure to Increase Revenue-Sharing for DAO Stakers**



Building on the previous proposal (ID#11) and considering the current slowdown in fee revenue from V1 and V2 situation, I propose introducing a new fee structure aimed at significantly enhancing the benefits for our dedicated DAO stakers.



Under the current system, only 40% of total Sakai transaction fees are shared with DAO stakers. To better incentivize participation and ensure the DAO remains attractive and rewarding, I propose increasing this revenue-sharing percentage to 80%. This adjustment would substantially boost the amount of fees shared with DAO stakers, providing a more consistent income stream and rewarding their continued support and involvement in the ecosystem.



A more rewarding fee-sharing model will attract and retain DAO members, contributing to the long-term stability and success of the Sakai Vault ecosystem.



This proposal will help DAO be more financially rewarding while fostering a stronger, more engaged DAO community. If approved, it will create a more sustainable model that benefits all DAO participants. Please vote "YES" if you guys agree with me.
