# Overview of V2 Conversion for Community Approval

**Overview of V2 Conversion for Community Approval**



The Sakai Vault Development Team would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the community for their ongoing support, active participation, and valuable contributions in the voting process. Your engagement has been crucial in shaping the direction of Sakai Vault, and with each approved proposal, we are making meaningful progress toward a more decentralized and rewarding platform.



As we move forward with the next steps, this proposal outlines key modifications that require the community’s vote to proceed with upcoming integration efforts while maintaining user rewards during the conversion to the V2 staking pool.



Key Updates:

1\. Settlement and Maintenance Days for V2 Staking Pool Conversion 

During all maintenance periods, we propose running settlement processes. This ensures that any rewards accrued by users since the V2 stoploss threshold date will be added to their claimable balances.



2\. Continuation of Daily Profits  

Users will continue to earn their usual daily profits until their existing staking contracts expire. The distribution of daily profits will remain consistent throughout the sUSD integration phase to ensure a smooth experience for all.



3\. Ongoing Activation of Rewards  

All current rewards will continue to be active and distributed for V2 users as normal, including:

   - Daily Interest

   - Commission Rewards: Sponsor Level Daily Income, Same Level Reward, and Ranking Reward.


4\. V2 Reward Conversion to sUSD

 All rewards, including daily interest and commissions, will be converted and claimable in sUSD (Sakai-Peg USD), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with users' USDT balances. Similar to the success of V1 conversion, this method ensures stability and security for users during and beyond the transition.



We urge all SakaiDAO community to consider and vote “YES” to approve these modifications for execution. The dev team remains committed to the community’s input and looks forward to working together as we enter this next exciting phase of growth.



Together, we’re creating a robust platform that rewards everyone involved and strengthens the Sakai ecosystem for the long term. Your vote counts, and we look forward to your participation in this transition of Sakai Vault.
