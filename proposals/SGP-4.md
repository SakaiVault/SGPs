# Proposal to Shift pending fund from Staking V1 to Liquidity Farming Program

Summary:

This proposal aims to transfer a portion of the pending fund currently staked in Sakai staking program to the farming protocol to optimise the returns.



Reason for Proposal:

The V1 staking has a claiming limit for stoploss occured in the past would affect the development of the program

Given the current market conditions and the potential for higher returns from Liquidity farming protocol, shifting a portion of the assets to farming could yield better overall returns for all users

We propose reallocating a certain percentage of the staked tokens to diversify the portfolio and increase total profits.




Proposal Details:



Scope of Transfer:

Percentage of tokens proposed for transfer: maximum 5% of the claimable amount

Current staking token: SAKAI

Liquidity Farming: SAKAI/PAXE 

Maximum time required for farming: 3 days

Token withdrawal options: PAXE



Requirements:

PAXE token buy: Buy PAXE token at the same value with SAKAI fund in order to farm

Regular Monitoring: The team should monitor and provide weekly reports on the farming program’s performance.



Objectives & Benefits:

Optimize Returns: With high APR from farming, stakers has the opportunity to increase assets without any claiming limitation

Diversification: Participating in farming helps diversify income streams and spread risk.

Flexibility: Users can reallocate assets between SAKAI and PAXE based on performance and market conditions.



Conclusion:

We believe this proposal will enable all users from staking V1 to take advantage of farming opportunities. This decision will be dependent on the approval of the DAO community and will be carried out cautiously to maximize long-term benefits for all users.
