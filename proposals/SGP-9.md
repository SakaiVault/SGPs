# Supplementary Proposal: Converting sUSD to pPAXE for Restaking

This proposal suggests a mechanism to allow users to convert their sUSD to pPAXE at a specified exchange ratio (e.g., 2 sUSD for 1 pPAXE). This will enable users to participate in the restaking program, offering additional earning opportunities through Sakai Vault's strategic partner - PAXE.




This conversion will encourage users the ability to join the restaking program, further compounding their rewards and optimizing their earning potential. As this can benefits and ties the Sakai Vault ecosystem more closely with PAXE in long-term, I hope this proposal will get a "YES" from everyone.
